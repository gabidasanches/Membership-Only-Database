# Membership-Only-Database


Description


   A members-only gym needs to be able to track members, their memberships and classes, and trainers. Weekly rotating classes are offered to members by appointment only on a first-come, first-serve basis. Members must be able to find out what classes are available, which trainers are teaching the classes, and which of them still have open spots.
Trainers employed by the gym teach classes, and they do so for an entire year. The trainers need to know which class(es) they have been assigned to teach and which members they have trained in order to upsell their personal training services.
   To guarantee membership renewals and charge members appropriately, the gym must be able to track which classes are being taken and by whom, along with membership status, how many additional classes have been purchased and frequency of visits. There are two types of members at this gym, corporate members, which are members that signed up through their work company and personal members, which are members that signed up by themselves. 
   The business will benefit from this project since the manager or gym owner will be able to analyze the data and determine which trainers are working better than others and how to improve their performance. They will be able to keep tabs on how many new members they have as well as how many classes both the new and returning members have been attending. They can also see different metrics on members. For example, they can look at the ages of different members and they can use this information to create classes that are appropriate for age ranges that are lacking in their gym. This system will also give the business the ability to see how many additional classes have been purchased by a member. Using this information and what the membership type of a member is, they can determine which members should be targeted to advertise upgrading their membership type. They may determine which classes and hours are the most popular and adjust the number of classes accordingly as well. The gym can also use the data in the system to determine if they need to restructure their memberships breakdown to have more than three levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold).
   The business will be able to see the information on trainers, review of the trainers made by the members, memberships, members, and classes and the project will be very useful in their decision making process in terms of figuring out how to best meet the needs of members and how to attract new members.
